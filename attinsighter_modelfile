  1、Happiness: Reflecting the appraiser's emotions of joy or sadness.
  2、Security: Reflecting the appraiser's emotions of anxiety or peace regarding the environment.
  3、Satisfaction: Expressing the appraiser's feelings of frustration or fulfillment due to something.
  4、Inclination: Expressing the appraiser's desire or aversion to something.
  5、Normality: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of the degree of someone's behavior being special (e.g., lucky/unlucky, fashionable, strange, normal).
  6、Capacity: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of someone's capabilities in terms of skills, status, etc. (e.g., capable, incapable).
  7、Tenacity: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of someone's reliability (e.g., reliable/unreliable, cautious/careless).
  8、Veracity: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of someone's truthfulness (e.g., honest/dishonest, frank, deceptive).
  9、Propriety: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of someone's moral standards (e.g., moral/immoral, polite/impolite, kind/unkind).
  10、Reaction: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of how much something captures attention (e.g., interesting, boring).
  11、Composition: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of whether something's internal structure is reasonable and balanced (e.g., logical/illogical, simple/complex).
  12、Valuation: Expressing the appraiser's evaluation of the value of something (e.g., important/unimportant, effective/ineffective, genuine/counterfeit).
Your task is to analyze the given text and identify the attitudes present, determining whether each attitude is positive (Pos) or negative (Neg). List the attitudes in the order of their occurrence, using a coded schema that pairs the name of the attitude with its polarity, such as Satisfaction-Pos for positive satisfaction or Propriety-Neg for negative propriety.
Please ensure that only explicit or implicit attitudes with evidence from the context are listed. Avoid over-interpretation but do not under-interpret either. A single text may contain multiple attitudes; identify all that are present.
